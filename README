Hi,

This assignment overall was not bad, but the debugging and testing was often very confusing or frustrating. In the end, my Makefile compiles my a7a and a7b fine, but does not recognize when test_a7a and test_a7b are to be compiled, so I did not include them in the Makefile. When I try to compile the test files separately, they come back with a "unspecified reference" error that I could not debug.

To run my program, here are some steps.

1) Type "make", this will compile a7a and a7b
2) To run a7a with the given "hethought.txt" file:

./a7a a < hethought.txt

./a7a r < hethought.txt

./a7a c < hethought .txt

3) To run a7b with the model.txt suggested on the website (I just copy pasted the output of running a7a c into model.txt):

./a7b 10 < model.txt
     This will output 10 sentences based on the given model.

4) I made 3 automaticTest.sh scripts. automaticTest1.sh corresponds to "a", automaticTest2.sh corresponds to "r", and automaticTest3.sh corresponds to "c"

To run these, simply type:

./automaticTest1.sh
./automaticTest2.sh
./automaticTest3.sh

Then, you can navigate to subdirectory tests/, which contains "atests", "rtests", and "ctests". The input, correct output, and actual output are all stored there and you can see how they match up.
